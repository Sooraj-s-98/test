Newton's laws of motion

Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They describe
 the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. More precisely,
 the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force, and the third as
serts that a single isolated force doesn't exist. These three laws have been expressed in several ways, over nearly three
 centuries,[a] and can be summarised as follows:

First law
In an inertial frame of reference, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless act
ed upon by a force.

Second law

In an inertial frame of reference, the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multip
lied by the acceleration a of the object  F = ma. (It is assumed here that the mass m is constant â€“ see below.)

Third law
When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposit
e in direction on the first body.
